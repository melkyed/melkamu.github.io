With over eight years of experience in the data domain, I am a Data Scientist who specializes in applying advanced quantitative and predictive modeling to solve complex problems across finance, healthcare, and education. My background is rooted in a rigorous academic foundation, holding a Master of Science in Applied Statistics and a Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics.

I pride myself on managing the full data lifecycle—from the architectural groundwork of ETL to the final delivery of visualization. Most recently, as a Senior Data Engineer at TD Bank Group, I led cloud migration projects on the Azure Platform, utilizing Databricks, PySpark, and SQL to optimize enterprise data management.

My technical expertise extends to machine learning and research. My work is further evidenced by my contributions as a lead and co-author on multiple publications regarding global health statistics and Bayesian modeling. I leverage this blend of statistical theory and technical fluency in Python, R, and cloud tools to drive measurable business value and innovation.
